# Apple Financial Statement Analysis
Main Highlights
1. “Big picture”: strong, rising gross margins & free-cash yield
2. Liquidity tightening vs. leverage strategy
3. Cash ROE/CROA as proof of financial flexibility
4. Volatility in net cash flows—contextualize strategic M&A and buybacks
5.  Apple remains hugely profitable and cash-generative, but with higher leverage and thinner liquidity buffers—a balanced “bull + risk” narrative.


Cash Return on Equity (Cash ROE)
Recent moves
2022: 241% → 2023: 178% → 2024: 208%
After peaking in 2022, Cash ROE dipped in ’23 but rebounded strongly in ’24.
Why it matters?
Shows how effectively Apple turns equity into cash flows—still well above historical averages (2014-19 range: 48–77%)
Highlight: the 2024 rebound to 208% underscores Apple’s continuing cash-generative power despite heavier leverage.

 Liquidity Trends
Downward drift in all three: from 1.5× current in 2019 to ~0.9× in 2024
Cash ratio halved since 2019 (0.95→0.37)
Highlight: Liquidity buffers have systematically tightened—worth discussing implications for short-term stress scenarios.

Leverage Dynamics
 Apple has leaned into debt (for share buybacks/dividends), boosting financial leverage—discuss the trade-off between lower WACC vs. higher coverage risk.
Debt / Equity nearly doubled since 2019, peaking in 2022
Equity ratio down from 56% to ~37%, meaning ~63% of assets are now debt-funded

Operational Efficiency
Apple’s scale still drives top‐quartile turnover ratios, though lean inventory models are loosening a bit.
High turnover (Asset & Fixed-Asset): peaked 2021–22, slight normalization in 2023–24
Inventory days up (rearward): from ~1.6 days in 2015 to ~3.2 days in 2024

Margin Stability
Continuous margin expansion on core products/services, driven by higher-margin Services and tighter cost control.
Gross margin climbed steadily, hitting 46% in 2024
Operating margin recovered to 32% after trough in 2020
Net margin very stable ~24–26%

EPS Growth
EPS stability at post-pandemic highs underscores return-of-capital strategy and resilient profitability.
EPS rose from $3.31 (2020) → $5.67 (2021) → plateauing ~$6.1 in 2022–24
Share buybacks support per-share metrics despite slowing absolute earnings growth

Cash Flow Ratios
Apple’s business generates free cash at a consistently high rate, enabling dividend hikes + buybacks while funding capex.
Free cash flow steady ~32–34% of revenue—industry-leading
CROA climbed into mid-30s in 2022, solid ~32% in 2024

Net Cash Flow Volatility
Seasonal and strategic cash uses cause net flow swings, emphasizing the strong underlying operating cash generation that cushions these moves.
2024: (-$794 M) vs. large inflows in ’23 (+$5.8 B) and outflows in ’22 (-$10.9 B)
Driven by swings in Investing (acquisitions, capex) and Financing (debt issuance/repurchases)
